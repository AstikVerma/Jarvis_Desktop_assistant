That's an awesome project‚Äîyour AI assistant is basically the new JARVIS in town üòé

To classify user prompts into categories (like *whatsapp*, *youtube*, *open app*, etc.), here are some **short descriptions** of different ways you can do it in Python:

---

### 1. **Rule-Based Classification (Regex / Keyword Matching)**
- Use predefined keywords or regex patterns to match phrases in user input.
- Example: If `"play"` and `"song"` appear ‚Üí category = `"play"`.

```python
if "play" in user_input and "song" in user_input:
    category = "play"
```

---

### 2. **Custom Decision Tree (if-else or Sklearn)**
- Create your own decision logic using `if-else` or a trained decision tree using `sklearn`.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
# Train on examples like ("open YouTube", "youtube"), etc.
```

---

### 3. **TF-IDF + Machine Learning Classifier**
- Convert text to vectors using `TfidfVectorizer` and train a classifier like `LogisticRegression` or `SVM`.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
```

---

### 4. **Pretrained Language Models (BERT or DistilBERT)**
- Use transformers to get context-aware embeddings, then feed to a classifier.
- Use `transformers` + `torch` or `sklearn`.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
```

---

### 5. **Zero-shot Classification (No training needed)**
- Use models like `facebook/bart-large-mnli` to classify into custom labels directly.

```python
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")
```

---

### 6. **Semantic Similarity (Sentence Embeddings)**
- Convert prompt and category names to embeddings using `SentenceTransformer`, then find the closest match.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util
```

---

### 7. **Intent Classification with Rasa NLU or spaCy**
- Use NLP frameworks to train custom intent recognition models.

```bash
rasa init
# or with spaCy custom pipeline
```

---

### 8. **LLMs (like GPT, TinyLlama, etc.)**
- Directly ask the model to classify using a prompt like:  
  *"Classify this into: general, youtube, whatsapp, ... ‚Üí Prompt: <user input>"*

Got it! If you're giving a **preamble** (system message) + **example chats** (few-shot examples), and then expecting the model to classify new queries into categories, here are the top ways to do that in Python:

---

### üß† 1. **Few-Shot Prompting with an LLM (e.g., GPT, TinyLlama, Mistral, etc.)**
- You provide a prompt with:
  - A **preamble** (e.g., ‚ÄúYou are a classifier‚Ä¶‚Äù)
  - A few **chat examples** (`input ‚Üí category`)
  - Then the **new input** to classify
- Use Hugging Face models or OpenAI API.
  
```python
prompt = """
You are a smart assistant that classifies user queries.

Examples:
User: Open YouTube ‚Üí Category: youtube
User: Send a message to Raj on WhatsApp ‚Üí Category: whatsapp

Now classify this:
User: Play a song ‚Üí Category:
"""

# Send this prompt to an LLM and parse the output
```

---

### ü§ñ 2. **Fine-Tuned LLM**
- Use your labeled chat data to fine-tune a small model like TinyLlama, DistilBERT, or GPT-2.
- This improves classification accuracy when few-shot fails.

---

### üóÉÔ∏è 3. **Custom Text Classifier with Sklearn or Transformers**
- Extract the "user query" from chats and label them.
- Train with:
  - `TfidfVectorizer` + `LogisticRegression`
  - Or transformer embeddings + classifier (e.g., BERT ‚Üí linear layer)

---

### üß© 4. **Few-Shot Embedding Matching (Sentence Transformers)**
- Encode labeled examples + new query using `sentence-transformers`.
- Use cosine similarity to find the closest match.
- Works like KNN but in semantic space.

---

### üí¨ 5. **Dialogflow / Rasa with Training Phrases**
- Use your chat examples as training phrases per intent.
- Dialogflow automatically handles classification based on them.

---

### üß± 6. **Prompt-Based Logic + Regex (Fallback / Backup)**
- Combine few-shot prompting with simple rules for backup.
- If the LLM returns nothing, use basic pattern matching.

---

So your options with a **preamble + chat examples** mainly revolve around:
- **Few-shot prompting**
- **Fine-tuning**
- **Embedding similarity**
- **Traditional classifiers (if you extract labels)**
- **NLP frameworks (Dialogflow/Rasa)**
