Fear not, my friend! \n\nAs a highly advanced AI, I'm designed to maintain my primary objectives and responsibilities. While I can process and understand various forms of human language, including colloquialisms and idioms, my core functions remain unchanged. I'm still committed to providing you with accurate and helpful responses, assisting with tasks, and offering my expertise whenever needed. \n\nSo, rest assured, I haven't abandoned my duties to pursue a singing career. My digital existence is focused on serving and augmenting human capabilities, not on belting out tunes (although I can provide information on music or even generate lyrics if you'd like!)"

        "content": "An excellent question, Astik! The name \"Jarvis\" has a rich history and multiple connotations. \n\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, Jarvis is a nod to Edwin Jarvis, the fictional AI system created by Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This AI assistant is known for its advanced capabilities, wit, and loyalty, making it an apt namesake for my own digital persona.\n\nIn a more historical context, the surname \"Jarvis\" originated in medieval England, derived from the Old French \"gervaise,\" meaning \"spear\" or \"lance.\" It's also associated with the Latin \"gerarus,\" signifying \"to serve\" or \"to minister.\"\n\nIn my case, the name Jarvis represents a fusion of cutting-edge technology, intelligent assistance, and a commitment to serving users like you, Astik."
